			<h1>Rock Ridge Marketing Education Courses</h1>

The courses teach students how to make good decisions in the economy that we live in today and encourage students to think like entrepreneurs.  Additionally, marketing education also urges students to participate in the Distributive Education Clubs of America, more commonly known by its abbreviation, DECA.
This organization allows students to participate in activities in local, state, and national levels and is a competitive program that prepares students for challenges in marketing and finance.</p>

			<h2 class = "sub">Marketing Co-Op and Non Co-Op</h2>
			<p class = "textc">The Marketing Co-Op and Marketing Non Co-Op courses are two of the most popular marketing courses our school offers to students. In this course, students learn about entry level jobs and the curriculum of this course combines the classroom instructional environment with supervised on-the-job training. Students learn about what is needed in the areas of human relations, communications, advertising, display, operations, sales, and products. 
			The students use computer activities and simulations to learn about how to think logically and critically in a business environment. In addition to this, guest speakers come to the school and talk with the students about various topics regarding economics and the workforce. Co-Op students are expected to be employed for the full year in a job related to marketing that is approved by the teacher. In addition to this, DECA plays a big role in this course.</p>
