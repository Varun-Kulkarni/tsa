			<h1>Rock Ridge Family and Consumer Science</h1>
			
			<p class = "area">The Family and Consumer Science courses at our school teach students more about our society and us as humans.  Classes such as Early Childhood and Human Development delve into more of how humans learn about the world around them and how they interact at earlier ages.  In addition to this, our FACS department has classes that focus more on the "here and now".
Such classes include our Gourmet Foods, Intro to Fashion Design, and Intro to Housing Design courses.  These kinds of courses encourage students to look at trends of newer products and new social ideas and what such trends may lead into.  FACS classes are unique in that they don't focus on specific areas like the other courses.  While other courses focus specifically on certain area, FACS courses take a broad approach and focus on our lifestyle and culture and also teach students practical skills they will need in life.</p>
			
			<h2 class = "sub">Early Childhood Education I & II</h2>
			<p class = "textc">This course focuses on the skills needed to pursue careers in education of children at very young ages.  The course covers early childhood, education of a child, services for children, how to care for children with certain needs and children in general as they grow older, etc.  Students learn about methods that children use to learn basic things such as
how a child first learns to write their name, how they solve math, and other simple tasks that, over time, help children progress onto higher grade of education.  Also, students learn about the logistics of child care facilities and how the workers in those facilities are trained to do their job. They visit child care facilities, elementary schools, and community childcare facilities to 
enhance their learning.</p>

			<figcaption class = "caption">This is the Early Childhood classroom.  Every morning, a batch of kids from the nearby elementary schools come to this classroom and interact with our high school students.  This allows our students to have first-hand experiences from taking care of children and will allow students to understand more about how children develop at early ages.  </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<h2 class = "sub">Human Development</h2>
			<p class= "textc">Human development is a course linked to Early Childhood Education and Leadership and is a helpful step for those interested in those courses.  During the course, students study the development of humans and analyze theories of human growth from birth to age six.  They study relations between social, physical, emotional, and intellectual development as a child grows.
Students also look into conditions that influence human growth and factors that may lead to certain growth patterns.</p>

			<h2 class = "sub">Gourmet Foods</h2>
			<p class = "textc">The Gourmet Foods course is a course that encourages implementation of science concepts from biology, chemistry, and a bit of physics to study foods.  Studies in this course include the relationship of these sciences to many different aspects of our health.  Such aspects include use of technology, nutrition, wellness, sports, exercise, food safety, and sanitation.
Students use a variety of online programs to study the nutrition of foods and understand the process behind planning eating habits and diets.  Along with this, the course relates food studies to much broader aspects other than human health such as global cultures and everyday concerns such as time and resource management.  Students get hands-on experience with preparing foods 
and making sure that they are planned, prepared, preserved, and served properly.  With this activity, students get an understanding of responsibility, accounting for themselves, interdependence, social skills, and effective teamwork skills</p>

Kitchens frequently have contests in class to test their creativity and cooking skills.</figcaption>

			<h2 class = "sub">Intro to Fashion Design and Merchandising</h2>
			<p class = "textc">This class focuses on fashion and the fashion industry.  Wardrobe planning and selection are a few things that are taught in the course, along with selection, accessorizing, and maintenance of clothing.  Students analyze fashion trends over the years and think about why such trends occurred as time passed.  Based on the experience and interest, a student can go into various
fashion projects for which they provide their own materials.</p>

			<h2 class = "sub">Intro to Housing and Interior Design</h2>
			<p class = "textc">Intro to Housing and Interior Design teaches students to use their creativity and real-world logic to make living environments that are modern and pleasant.  Students learn how to make floor plans, blueprints and other housing design documents and how to make them like the housing companies we know today do.  They also learn about the fundamentals of furnishings, various living areas, and accessories
in a home.  Interior decorating principles are also covered as are housing structures and other building structures.  Students use computers to make interior and exterior designs as well as a landscape design to show what they have learned about designing homes.  In addition to this, students also work on models for the designs they have made.</p>

				<figcaption class = "caption">The Housing classroom is a small classroom, but its layout allows for a lot of group-work in designing sketches.  Students use both paper and pencil and computer software to look at and come up with new designs for houses and the classroom is filled with lots of creativity and planning</figcaption>
