<h2 class = "sub">Inside of Cell Phones</h2>

<p class = "textc">
Cell phones benefit our society in many ways but can be very harmful if they are not properly recycled. Cell phones contain highly precious materials such as gold, copper, and silver which are toxic to our environment but can be reused. By recycling this technology the world can reduce 70% of the toxic pollution. The lead is the most dangerous material used in cell phones, which causes most of the overall pollution in our community. Gold and silver are one of the most expensive material present in the cell phones. An average cell phone has 300 mg of silver and 30 mg of gold. Additionally, there are several parts that can be recycled such as circuit board, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screens, lenses, and speakers. These parts when recycled are used in other industries where precious metal such as gold, silver, and bronze are sold.  60 million dollars are wasted when cell phones are not recycled properly. LCD screens are found in compatible devices and acts like a shutter allowing light to pass or blocking the light from passing. 12.5% of e-waste is currently recycled out of all different electronics. This number shows the limited amount of technology that is currently recycled and the 87.5% that causes harm to the environment. </p>

<h2 class = "sub">Harmful Effects of Cell Phones</h2>  
<p class = "textc">
Not recycling cell phones is extremely harmful and dangerous to our community and also causes wastes of countless precious metals that can be useful in various ways. For example, during the process of recycling cell phones, cadmium, if leaked into the air, causes harms such as neurological problems to human health if breathed in. Additionally, metals and nickels are hazardous chemicals that can start fire once they get in contacts with water. This causes damage to the land as well as ocean life. It is found that 1.8 billion new cell phones were made but only 3% of it were actually recycled. Not only do these harm our environment, but precious metals in a cell phone are wasted if we don't recycle cell phones properly. These metals can be used to sell in a jewelry shop and reused when refined to be sold and make money of the precious metals. Additionally, these metals can also be reused in another electronics causing less amounts of metal being wasted. Recycling our cell phones can save great amounts of precious metal and not cause damage to our environment. </p>

<li class = "mainPageLists"><u> Methylmercury effects</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc"> Mercury is a chemical found in cell phones, and it has a harmful impact on the environment as well as humans that get in contact with it. <br>
Methylmercury can impair neurological development. Methylmercury can pollute the water, such as rivers, lakes, and oceans. This poisons and kills ocean life such as fish and shellfish. People that eat the fish and shellfish that contain methylmercury, can damage their brain and nervous system. Impacts on cognitive thinking, memory, attention, language, and fine motor and visual spatial skills have been seen in children exposed to methylmercury. Recent human biological monitoring by the shows that most people have blood mercury levels below a level associated with possible health effects. <br>
Outbreaks of methylmercury poisonings have made it clear that adults and children are at risk from ingestion exposure to methylmercury. During these poisoning outbreaks some mothers with no symptoms of nervous system damage gave birth to infants with severe disabilities.<br>
In addition more symptoms of methylmercury poisoning may include; impairment of the peripheral vision; disturbances in; lack of coordination of movements; impairment of speech, hearing, walking; and muscle weakness. </p><br>
<li class = "mainPageLists"><u> Mercury and Cancer</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc"> Mercuric chloride has caused increases in several types of tumors in rats and mice, and methylmercury has caused kidney tumors in male mice. Scientists only observed these health effects at extremely high doses, above levels that produced other effects. </p><br>
<li class = "mainPageLists"><u> Elemental mercury effects </u><br></li>
<p class = "textc"> Elemental (metallic) mercury primarily causes health effects when it is breathed as a vapor where it can be absorbed through the lungs. These exposures can occur when elemental mercury is spilled or products that contain elemental mercury break and expose mercury to the air, particularly in warm or poorly-ventilated indoor spaces. Symptoms include these: tremors; emotional changes; insomnia; neuromuscular changes; headaches; disturbances in sensations; changes in nerve responses; performance deficits on tests of cognitive function. At higher exposures there may be kidney effects, respiratory failure and death. </p><br>
<li class = "mainPageLists"><u> Effects of other mercury compounds (inorganic and organic)</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc"> High exposures to inorganic mercury may result in damage to the gastrointestinal tract, the nervous system, and the kidneys. Both inorganic and organic mercury compounds are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and affect other systems. <br>
Symptoms of high exposures to inorganic mercury include: skin rashes and dermatitis; mood swings; memory loss; mental disturbances; and muscle weakness.</p>

<h2 class = "sub">Recycling Cell Phones</h2>
<p class = "textc">
Recycling one million cell phones can allow us to reuse 50 lb of gold, 550 lb of silver, and 20 lb of palladium. These metals together are worth 2.5 billion dollars. Statistics show that an individual purchases a new cell phone every 18 months, a high amount of expensive and precious metals are discarded. Statistics show that United States of America has about 327 million cell phones. USA is known to be the third country after China and India to have the most amount of cell phones. By simply throwing away the cell phone, we are harming our own society with toxins and throwing away precious metals. Therefore, there are many companies that allow individuals to recycle their electronics properly without causing much harm to our environment. It is vital to recycle all used electronics so we can save precious metals, money, and protect our environment.

<p class = "intro"> How to Recycle</p>
<ul>
	<li class = "textc">The phones are dismantled and then sorted into different categories such as batteries, circuit boards, plastic, metals, and chargers. </li>
<li class = "textc">Each of these items is   recycled differently</li>
	<li class = "textc">Batteries are recycled uniquely.<a href = "batteryrecycling.html">Please click here to find the recycling methods of batteries.</a></li>
	<li class = "textc">Circuit boards are taken to Singapore and other recycling industries so that the valuable metals such as gold and silver can be extracted and reused.</li>
	<li class = "textc">Plastic is a material found in electronics and it is the most complicated and difficult material to recycle. </li>
<li class = "textc">It is recycled by washing and drying a polymer called Polypropylene and melting it to a liquid state. Then it is molded to be used in other objects.</li>
