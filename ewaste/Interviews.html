<div id ="Sailesh"><h4 class = "inthead"><u><b>Our Interview with Mr. Sailesh Banaji</b></u></h4>
 
<p class = "during">During our interview we learned several things from someone that was directly connected to the process of E-Waste recycling.</p>
<br>
<p class = "wwl"><b>What we learned:</b></p>


<p class = "textc">During our interview we learned that the best way to solve the e-waste is to take out as much e-waste from the environment by recycling and reusing it. Mr. Sailesh Banaji works at Q-Logic, where the policy is that the company has to recycle 100% of the  material that is given to the company. At this company, batteries, servers, monitors, and cell phones are recycled. Once the e-waste is recycled the costumer gets a certificate saying that all of the e-waste has been recycled with the industry standards ground up and re-used. This company visits other companies to check up on them to make sure that the companies are disposing e-waste properly. </p>

<br>


<p class = "textc">The e-waste is recycled into parts for new objects. They are trying to look for new solutions by figuring out what would work, and trying to reduce toxic chemicals in the technology products in the first place so that when the technology is disposed, the e-waste isn&#8217;t as much of a threat to the environment. Each technology piece is recycled differently. For example a lamp is recycled differently than a circuit board. Some items are melted and re-used, and some can be used again without making changes. Cities made laws to fine those that throw away electronics instead of recycling them. Educational programs and e-waste collection locations have helped to collect more e-waste for recycling. Events for collections each year are made, and there are permanent locations to collect e-waste. </p>

<br>


<p class = "textc">Inside-printed circuit boards with arsenic, lead, and zinc are hardest to recycle because they contain many toxic chemicals and have many different chemicals, because toxic chemicals are really good conductors. Batteries are also hard to recycle because of the acids and toxic material;. There are also graphite, carbon, in batteries. Health is a main concern when referring to e-waste because e-waste can release toxic chemicals into the air, thereby polluting the air with harmful chemicals. </p>

<br>


<p class = "textc">Large items are recycled by being broken down into different sections. 60% of every car is made of recycled materials. The cars are dismantled and so are its components. The metal is sent to refineries. All e-waste components in the car is recycled. Even the rubber is recycled to be used in childrens' playgrounds. The only thing not recycled is the cloth, engine block and parts, and some plastics. The items that are not reused are burned. Ways to bring attention to this issue is by educating the public about the harms of e-waste. To do this, information must be available. </p>

<br>


<p class = "textc">E-waste is a big problem because materials get into the ground, air, and water and harm people, animals, and plants. Chemicals leak into groundwater. Acid rain is caused by the burning off e-waste in landfills. The use of fiber optics, carbon fiber, and less toxic materials can reduce the e-waste problem. We should keep trying to find new methods and innovate new ways to use less toxic material in the technology that we build so that it doesn&#8217;t create much pollution. Hydrogen batteries and HCVs can also reduce the e-waste. We should try to build our technology using less toxic chemicals so that not as much e-waste will be created. The most important thing we can do right now is educate the public and be responsible and recycle. </p>

<br>


<p class = "textc">The recycling companies make money by recovering the precious metals in the e-waste, refining it, and selling to other companies. 60%-80% of plastic companies plastic is recycled plastic. If we didn’t recycle e-waste, then there would be mountains of scrap, we would run out of space, the soil, water and air would be contaminated, and diseases will most likely be created through the pollution caused by harmful e-waste toxins.</p>

<br>


<p class = "textc">A majority of car parts are able to be recycled, the only parts that are not able to be recycled are the cloth on the seats, some engine parts, and rubber hoses. All e-waste parts of the car, however, can be recycled. To recycled large items like cars, everything needs to be taken apart, or dismantled, and sent to a refinery. Recycling lead acid batteries will help the environment. Lead soldering is a major e-waste issue because the lead, a highly toxic material, would leak into the environment. The circuit boards, once they start to decompose, are very dangerous because the metal evaporate and once you breath it, it will cause health problems. Some e-waste is melted, and some is used again. Batteries are hard to recycle again because they contain graphite, carbon, and acidic material. Inside circuit boards are also hard to recycle because they contain toxic things. However, the parts of the circuit boards are recycled again into jewelry. The way that these companies get money is that they take the precious metals from the circuit boards and other things such as gold and silver and sell it to other companies. The plastic gets sold to plastic companies. </p>

<br>


<p class = "textc">Some solutions that Mr. Sailesh mentioned were education outreach programs, e-waste collections, small set ups, collection events every once in a while with advertising to draw attention, permanent set ups, where people can count on to go drop off their things. Hydrogen batteries is also another solution because they contain no chemicals, so they are not as bad for the environment. Overall the biggest solution is trying to reduce pollution when creating objects, by being wise of what chemicals are added, and considering how to create the object so that it would be easy to recycle when used up. We would try to recycle more, make better, environmentally friendly technology, and innovate new ideas for cutting down e-waste pollution.</p>

<div id = "Scott"><h4 class = "inthead"><u><b>Our Interview with Scott at Forever Green Recycling</b></u></h4>

<p class = "during">During our interview we learned several things from someone that was directly connected to organizing e-waste material.</p>
<br>
<p class = "wwl"><b>What we learned:</b></p>


<img src="..\IMG\ewaste\scott1.jpg" alt = "Forever Green Recycling's manager Scott with a stack of PC's about to be recycled" style=  "border: solid black 1px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="..\IMG\ewaste\scott2.jpg" alt = "One of our team members with a disk drive that is to be recycled" style = "border: solid black 1px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<img src="..\IMG\ewaste\scott4.jpg" alt = "A big box of computer parts including fans, wiring, and plastics that will be separated and recycled" style = "border: solid black 1px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="..\IMG\ewaste\scott5.jpg" alt = "A box of PCs that need to be dismantled" style=  "border: solid black 1px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;




<p class = "textc">Each element has a different melting point. As each element melts separately, it is collected, and sold for money. The recycling process takes about 1.5 hours. The gas and fumes in the tv make it harder to recycle.  In addition, certain elements such as Mercury are in televisions, so recycling them safely is a big concern.  The only pollution that e-waste makes is during shipping. The ships create pollution. Plastic is sorted by color and recycled to be used for different things. Its sorted by color so that the white plastic doesn't become dark and can be used for something else. A big problem is that manufacturers are not taking responsibility for TV e-waste, and are letting TVs create pollution. Every e-waste item no matter how big or small are dismantled or taken apart to be recycled. The best way to recycle e-waste is to use the most efficient process. To recycle we must reuse it, fix it, or recycle it. The most important thing we can do right now is to build our technology wisely. We need to consider what the consequences will be once the technology is used. Some solutions we can implement include drawing more attention to the problem by educating the public, and recycling more and more of our electronics. We need to be attentive of what is going into the trash and recycle.</p>

<div id ="Throy"><p><h4 class = "inthead"><u><b>Our Interview with Throy at Potomac E-Scrap</b></u></h4>

<p class = "during">During our interview we learned several things from someone that was in charge of the whole recycling process.</p>
<img src="..\IMG\ewaste\pEscrap1.jpg" alt = "Thory and a worker talking to us about what the workers do to recycle products" style="border: solid black 1px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="..\IMG\ewaste\pEscrap2.jpg" alt = "An overlook of the E-Scrap's recycling line" style="border: solid black 1px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="..\IMG\ewaste\pEscrap3.jpg" alt = "A rolling belt with computer parts that have been dismantled" style="border: solid black 1px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p class = "wwl"><b>What we learned:</b></p>

<p class = "textc">During our interview with Throy we learned that a good incentive for making people recycle e-waste is to pay the consumer money based on how much their e-waste weighs. Setting up e-waste bins is also another good way to make people recycle more. We also learned that led lights are better for the environment than regular lights. CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) televisions are hard to recycle because they costs a lot, and they contain a lot of lead and heavy metal. A desktop is the easiest to recycle because it can easily be taken apart. This company receives about 25-50 customers a week. PCB (Polychlorinated Biphenyl) liquid is very hard to handle because it is very toxic. It is illegal to have it in electronics these days, however there are some technologies that still contain it.  Identifying different metals, and creating efficient space for recycling can make e-waste recycling easier. Some biotechnology help with the e-waste problem by decomposing plastic and metals faster. For example, some fungi helps to decompose plastic. Processing with pneumatics helps cut down e-waste, while not creating any pollution at all. Making highly toxic materials illegal is another solution to making e-waste recycling easier. A little to no pollution is created through e-waste recycling. E-waste can turn into anything. Sometimes memory on hard disks and other drives need to be wiped off, and to do that, the object needs to be shredded. Biotech is also useful in recovering small metals from e-waste objects. Sometimes the separation is done by people, but sometimes it is done by machines called the WEEE (Waste Electronic & Electrical Equipment) machines.  Such machines include shredders and grinders that autonomously break down e-waste. Lead acid batteries are better than most batteries because they can be turned into new batteries by having the lead acid replaced. Some things that consumers can do to help e-waste centers is separating electronics from other materials.</p>

<br>

<p class = "textc">Improving manufacturing in general by having manufacturers pay attention to the impact that their technology can have on the environment while they are building can be a huge solution to this problem. Many manufacturers don't tell e-waste centers how to recycle the products, or make the technology so that the products are very hard to dismantle. However, some companies do well in telling e-waste centers how to recycle and dismantle the products, or make dismantling  the product very easy to do in the first place. By having all companies follow this example, we can make recycling e-waste much, much easier. A better labor force can also improve the efficiency of e-waste recycling. Determining the metal content can make ewaste recycling much easier. Mandates that force manufacturers tell the e-waste companies how to recycle their product will also make it much easier to recycle. Smaller objects cause more pollution because they are hard to dismantle. Lithium batteries are also hard to recycle. Objects can be dismantled or melted in smelters with boil metals into a different form. Some companies are thinking of either melting the lead out of CRT glass, or using it to cover landfills.Some batteries such as the lead acid can be reused, however, alkaline batteries are not good. Consumers should be careful what they buy, and not purchase things that are harmful to the environment such as alkaline batteries. Support from manufacturers to build objects that can be taken apart can be helpful to the e-waste recycling process. This business has recycling events for those who want to drop by and recycle their electronics. They also use an assembly line which makes recycling more efficient and faster in break down materials.</p>

<br>


<p class = "textc">This company also has two major certifications that allow it to recycle e-waste legally and properly.  The certifications are the Responsible Recycling Practices (R2) and Recycling Industry Operating Standards (RIOS) certifications.  There are many more such certifications that companies can receive to legally practice e-waste recycling, and it is important that companies get these certifications so that they know how to recycle e-waste properly.</p>
