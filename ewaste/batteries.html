<p class = "textc">Batteries are used in many electronic devices. Most batteries contain cadmium, lead, zinc, silver and many other toxic metals. When batteries are thrown away, toxic pollution is released. The toxic chemicals and acids in the batteries leak into the air, water, and ground once they end up in landfills. When different toxic chemicals from batteries are mixed together in the air, they might affect the biological system of an individual by causing a loss of DNA. Similarly, diseases such as the heart disease and cancer are caused by breathing in toxic pollution caused by burning batteries. Additionally, this can harm the environment, causing harm to not only humans but also animals and plant. If batteries aren’t recycled properly, they can cause major damage in the environment and also harm living things such as plants and animals. However, the Loudoun County e-waste center conducts many programs throughout the year where they offer opportunities for individuals to correctly recycle their batteries, instead of throwing them away, which causes pollution. </p>
<p class = "inthead">Critical Components</p>
  <p class = "textc">Battery pollution is identiﬁed as a problem in the community because they are made from a variety of chemicals to power their reactions. Some of these chemicals, such as lead, nickel and cadmium, are extremely toxic and can cause harm to humans and the environment.</p>

<p class = "textc">Batteries have many dangerous chemicals and acids, and precautions must be taken to even touch a damaged battery. This is because they contain lead and sulfuric acids.

Battery pollution is identiﬁed as a problem in the community because are made from a variety of chemicals to power their reactions. Some of these chemicals, such as lead, nickel and cadmium, are extremely toxic and can cause harm to humans and the environment.

Batteries have many dangerous chemicals and acids, and precautions must be taken to even touch a damaged battery. This is because they contain lead and sulfuric acids. </p>

<p class = "textc">Recycling is known to be the most popular solution to decrease the pollution of e-wastes. Most companies dismantle different parts of electronics and recycle each of them separately. The three components of batteries, plastics, lead, and sulfuric acid are recycled differently.</p>

<p class = "inthead">Lead Acid</p>

<p class = "textc">Several countries have labeled lead acid as hazardous material, and with good reason. Lead is a toxic metal that can enter the body in several different ways. It can enter the body by inhalation of lead dust or ingestion when touching the mouth. When batteries are disposed of, they get thrown into landfills, in which they get the opportunity to pollute the ground, air, and water. If leaked onto the ground, the acid and lead contaminate the soil and become airborne when dry. Children are most vulnerable to lead exposure. High amounts of lead exposure of lead can affect a child’s growth, cause brain damage, harm kidneys, impair hearing and induce behavioral problems. In adults, lead can cause memory loss and lower the ability to concentrate, as well as harm the reproductive system. Lead is also known to cause high blood pressure, nerve disorders, and muscle and joint pain. Researchers believe that Ludwig van Beethoven became ill and died because of lead poisoning. Lead is most commonly found in batteries, so it is very important that the batteries are disposed of properly, or better yet, recycled to ensure that the lead doesn’t seep out and harm others. </p>

<p class = "inthead"> Sulfuric Acid</p>

<p class = "textc">The sulfuric acid in a lead acid battery is even more harmful than the lead acid. Eye contact can cause permanent blindness and swallowing can damage internal organs and potentially lead to death. </p>

<p class = "inthead">Cadmium</p>

<p class = "textc">Cadmium, which is used in nickel-cadmium batteries, is considered more harmful than lead if ingested. Workers at the Nickel-Cadmium batteries manufacturing plants in Japan have been experiencing health problems from prolonged exposure to the metal. Some governments have even banned disposal of nickel-cadmium batteries in landfills. The soft, whitish metal that occurs naturally in the soil can damage kidneys, so the cadmium found in batteries is even more hazardous to health. Cadmium can be absorbed through the skin by touching a spilled battery. For example, cadmium can cause harm to the environment. For example is can cause damage to soil micro-organisms and affect the breakdown of organic matter. It can also bio-accumulate in ﬁsh, which reduces their numbers and makes them unﬁt for human consumption</p>

<p class = "inthead">Nickel</p>
<p class = "textc">Nickel-metal-hydride batteries are also very toxic as well because of the high amount of nickel they contain. Nickel is one of many carcinogenic metals known to be an environmental and occupational pollutant. High exposure to nickel has been connected with increased risk of lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological deficits, developmental deficits in childhood, and high blood pressure.

Nickel exposure introduces free radicals which lead to oxidative damage and may also affect the kidneys and liver. Once a government agency administered liver function tests to 25 nickel-plating workers. Results showed they overwhelmingly suffered from compromised liver function.

Nickel is believed to bind to estrogen receptors and mimic the actions of estrogen. It is well established that lifetime estrogen exposure is a breast cancer risk factor. Additionally, nickel has been identified as a toxin that severely damages reproductive health and the nervous system.

First, nickel causes essential metal imbalances. It severely disrupts enzyme action and regulation. Finally, it causes and contributes to a high amount of oxidative stress

Workers who inhale nickel laced dust and fumes are at an increased risk for lung cancer and fibrosis.</p>

<h2 class = "sub">How to Recycle </h2>
<p class = "intro">Plastics</p>
<hr>

<p class = "textc">Plastic is a material found in electronics and it is the most complicated and difficult material to recycle. It is recycled by washing and drying a polymer called Polypropylene and melting it to a liquid state. The liquid is shaped into a certain way, and hardened, to be used in making new batteries. When plastic is littered, many chemicals such as cadmium and lead are released into the air and are spread into the environment and ocean, killing many organisms from poisoning. Killing organisms, leads to decreasing the amount of animals in the food chain, which end up disrupting the ecosystem. The pollution causes many organisms to die from the toxic pollution, starvation, and loss of shelter. Plastic is a dangerous element in batteries and should be recycled to decrease the amount of harm to the environment.</p>
<br>

<p class = "intro">Lead</p>
<hr>

<p class = "textc">Lead is recycled by first cleaning the lead, heating it, and then melting it down to a liquid which is then poured into mold. Impurities, that are caused, are then extracted from the mold and cooled down and sent to a battery manufacturer. Lead is known to be the fifth most widely-used in technologies. It is harmful if exposed in small amounts and can cause vomiting, diarrhea, coma, and death. However, in larger amounts it can cause severe brain damage and blood disorders. Lead causes harm to the environment from its toxic effect on plants, animals, and micro-organisms, so it should be recycled to prevent any further harm to our community.   </p>
<br>

<p class = "intro">Sulfuric Acid</p>
<hr>

<p class = "textc"> Sulfuric acid is recycled by neutralizing, turning it into water, and testing it to see whether it is safe to be disposed. It can also be recycled by processing it and converting it to sodium sulfate. Sulfuric acid is a substance most commonly found in the air, however, it can be found in the water and environment as well. It heats up once it is in contact with water, which can cause damage to the ocean-life. More sulfuric acid is produced in the United States than in any other nation, so people in the United States can be easily exposed to the dangerous chemical by simply breathing it in. Sulfuric acid is a dangerous chemical that harms the ocean and many land organisms including humans, so it is important that it be recycled properly.</p>
