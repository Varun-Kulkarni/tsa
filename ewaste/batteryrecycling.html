<p class = "intro"> How to Recycle</p>
<hr> 
<ul>
	<li class = "textc">Batteries are organized based on the composition of the elements in them. </li>
<br> 
	<li class = "textc">First, the combustible material is removed and the metal is left behind. </li>
<br> 
	<li class = "textc">Then, the cells in the metals are chopped into small pieces and then heated until the metal is melted down. </li>
<br> 
	<li class = "textc">It is known that 6-10 times more energy is used to obtain metal from recycling.</li>
<br> 
	<li class= "textc">Battery recycling is a complicated process which takes a lot of time, but helps the environment in the end. </li> 
</ul>

<br><p class = "inthead">Major Parts of Batteries</p>


<p class = "intro">Plastics</p>
<hr>

<p class = "textc">Plastic is a material found in electronics and it is the most complicated and difficult material to recycle. It is recycled by washing and drying a polymer called Polypropylene and melting it to a liquid state. The liquid is shaped into a certain way, and hardened, to be used in making new batteries. When plastic is littered, many chemicals such as cadmium and lead are released into the air and are spread into the environment and ocean, killing many organisms from poisoning. Killing organisms, leads to decreasing the amount of animals in the food chain, which end up disrupting the ecosystem. The pollution causes many organisms to die from the toxic pollution, starvation, and loss of shelter. Plastic is a dangerous element in batteries and should be recycled to decrease the amount of harm to the environment. </p>
<br>

<p class = "intro">Lead</p>
<hr>

<p class = "textc">Lead is another harmful toxin in batteries, that can kill many organisms. It is recycled by first cleaning the lead, heating it, and then melting it down to a liquid which is then poured into mold. Impurities, that are caused, are then extracted from the mold and cooled down and sent to a battery manufacturer. Lead is known to be the fifth most widely-used in technologies. It is harmful if exposed in small amounts and can cause vomiting, diarrhea, coma, and death.  However, in larger amounts it can cause severe brain damage and blood disorders. Lead causes harm to the environment from its toxic affect on plants, animals, and micro-organisms, so it should be recycled to prevent any further damage to our community.   </p>
<br>

<p class = "intro">Sulfuric Acid</p>
<hr>

<p class = "textc"> Sulfuric acid is recycled by neutralizing, turning it into water, and testing it to see whether it is safe to be disposed. It can also be recycled by processing it and converting it to sodium sulfate. Sulfuric acid is a substance most commonly found in the air, however, it can be found in the water and environment as well. It heats up once it is in contact with water, which can cause damage to the ocean-life. More sulfuric acid is produced in the United States than in any other nation, so people in the United States can be easily exposed to the dangerous chemical by simply breathing it in. Sulfuric acid is a dangerous chemical that harms the ocean and many land organisms including humans, so it is important that it be recycled properly. 
</p> 

<p class = "inthead">Recycling Different Types of Batteries</p>
<p class = "intro">Lithium Ion Batteries</p>
<hr>
<p class = "textc">Plastics and metal components are separated from the battery and heated up. The high temperature metals are solidified and the low temperature metals, such as zinc, are separated. These batteries are completely reusable</p><br>

<p class = "intro">Nickel Cadmium</p>
<hr>
<p class = "textc">The high temperature batteries are brought to the molten metal bath, where they are solidified by the use of the casting operation. </p><br>

<p class = "intro">Lithium Batteries</p>
<hr>
<p class = "textc">These batteries are exposed by using a shredder or high speed hammer. Then they are dissolved into caustic water. </p><br></div>
