<h2 class = "sub">Inside a Computer</h2>
<p class = "textc">Computers are a huge part of e-waste in our community.  They have certain specific materials that are toxic and have a harmful impact on both humans and the environment.  Like other technology that has a screen, computer monitors have cadmium and mercury used to make images to display on the screen cleanly.  In addition to this, the circuit boards in computers have mercury and chromium in them, used to further efficiently run the circuits and processors on the circuit board.  In addition to these, older computers with CRT (Cathode-Ray Tube) screens have up to 8 pounds of lead.  CRT monitors are monitors that use an electron “gun” to pass electrons through an anode and a cathode.  The gun heats material which then gives off electrons.  These electrons fly through the glass tube and are bent and focused using a series of anodes before they reach the monitor screen.  For a given CRT, according to a paper for the OECD, the fixture that holds the monitor face to the funnel through where electrons are passed has the most lead, up to 75% of the frit material can be lead.  The funnel has up to 25% lead (among other materials used) and the electron gun has about 30% lead.  Newer LCD screened laptops have significantly less lead in them, but there is still enough that there is a concern when not recycling LCD monitors.</p>

<h2 class = "sub">Harmful Effects of Computers</h2>
<p class = "textc">The main materials that are harmful in computers are lead and mercury.  Lead and mercury are used to enhance the display while cadmium can be used in the circuit boards.  These materials are extremely harmful though, and cause a lot of health effects above anything.  One of the biggest problems in recycling (and simply using) computers and other screen-related devices is lead poisoning.  According to Mayo Clinic, lead poisoning can cause severe abdominal pain and constipation.  In addition to this, like other radiation, lead can change internal body systems, especially nervous, growth, reproductive systems.  It is especially fatal to children because it tampers with their growth system which can lead to abnormal disorders later in their life.  </p>
<p class = "textc">Mercury is also a very critical element to look out for in electronics.  Computers and TVs especially contain large amounts of mercury, and this can be harmful both biologically and environmentally.  The biggest problem that we face with mercury is the fact that it can release a neurotoxin called methylmercury.  This can be found almost anywhere mercury is released, either in the air, the water, the soil, anywhere.  Like in humans, methylmercury can cause abnormal growth and reproduction in animals, which is why it must be controlled to reduce the risk of endangering species.  </p>
<p class = "textc">One of the last materials in computers that is extremely important to recycle is the polychlorinated biphenyls (or PCBs).  These are chemicals that used to be used in older electronics for capacitors, transformers, and other electronic components in circuitry.  PCBs can cause irritation of lungs and nose as well as possible liver failure.  In addition, a sudden surge skin conditions like rashes and acne have links to PCB exposure</p>

<h2 class = "sub">Recycling Computers and Monitors</h2>
<p class = "textc">According to the EPA, there are 112,000 computers that are discarded everyday just in the United States of America. However, only 13% of these electronics are recycled and so a lot of pollution is being created. 80-85% of the electronic products produced are toxic and cause harm to the environment when thrown away carelessly. Recycling 1 million laptops can save the amount of energy used by 3,657 U.S. homes in a year.  In addition to this, recycling computers (and any e-waste) regularly can reduce the health risks for us.  As more and more people recycle, we could potentially find ways to get rid of harmful materials from the environment and reduce lead poisoning and methylmercury in our world.  We could also reconsider our designs to get rid of such harmful materials and use better, more efficient yet more green material in new products.

<h2 class = "sub">Brominated Flame Retardants</h2>
<p class = "textc">Brominated flame retardants is a commonly found in computer monitors. This is known to contaminate the environment and cause health concerns in humans and animals that come in high contact with it. New research showed evidence that maternal exposure to this type of flame retardant, known as PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers), can change the thyroid function in pregnant women and children which can result in low birth weights, and impair neurological development.<br>
Laboratory studies show that other health effects can be changes in the brain development to altered hormone function and cause cancer. PBDEs, used primarily as flame retardants in furniture, are structurally similar to the known human toxicants PBBs, PCBs, dioxins, and furans. In addition to having toxic properties in animal studies, they also bio-accumulate in both humans and animals and persist in the environment. </p>

<h2 class = "sub">Bromine</h2>
<li class = "mainPageLists"><u> Disrupts Thyroid Function</u><br></li>

<p class = "textc">Exposure to bromine severely impacts the thyroid gland and causes hormonal issues. Bromine and iodine are absorbed in similar fashion and animal research has found that bromine exposure limits availability of iodine to the thyroid and interferes with hormone production. The flame retardant PCBE, for example, has specifically has acted as a thyroid and endocrine disruptor. This is a big problem because an impaired thyroid can lead to hypothyroidism, goiter, and hormonal imbalance. </p>

<li class = "mainPageLists"><u> Increased Risk of Preterm Birth and Birth Defects</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc">When bromine replaces iodine during pregnancy, expectant mothers may be at an increased risk for delivering preterm babies. An Australian study even reported a link between bromide exposure and birth defects. </p>

<li class = "mainPageLists"><u>Slows Neural and Cognitive Development</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc">Children exposed to high levels of brominated compounds (PBDEs) in flame retardants have shown to have developmental issues. In one study, researchers tracked children born with high levels of PBDEs for six years. At all stages, their mental and physical development lagged behind children with lower levels of PBDEs. </p>


<li class = "mainPageLists"><u>Cognitive Failure</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc">Mental dysfunction related to the overexposure to bromine is called bromism. The patient experienced problems including fatigue, headache, memory problems, and loss of muscle control.</p>

<li class = "mainPageLists"><u>Contributes to Mental Illness</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc">Psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental health issues are caused by bromine exposure. In some cases, reducing bromine levels decreased or eliminated schizophrenia symptoms. </p>


<li class = "mainPageLists"><u>Skin Disorders</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc">When bromine comes in direct contact with the skin, it can irritate or burn. Exposure to bromine has also been linked to the development of cherry angiomas and lesions. These skin disorders were observed in individuals who took bromine for nerve conditions. </p>

<li class = "mainPageLists"><u>DNA Damage</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc">Recent research has determined that potassium bromate causes oxidative damage to DNA. To date, the research has involved animals as well as the human population. </p>

<li class = "mainPageLists"><u>Carcinogenic Potential</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc">The International Agency for the Research on Cancer has identified potassium bromate as a known carcinogen, which is a substance capable of causing cancer in living tissue.</p>

<li class = "mainPageLists"><u>Toxic to the Kidneys</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc">Potassium bromate is a known kidney toxin and has killed human embryonic kidney cells in lab tests. Laboratories have shown that bromine is a major cause of kidney damage. </p>

<li class = "mainPageLists"><u>Hearing Loss</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc">Ears require a balance of potassium and sodium, two minerals that are helpful for promoting proper hearing. When tested on animals, potassium bromate created chemical imbalances within the inner ear. Bromine has shown to cause hearing damage when interfering with the potassium and sodium in the ear. </p>

<li class = "mainPageLists"><u>Protecting Yourself from Bromine</u><br></li>
<p class = "textc">In order to reduce exposure to Bromine, we need to recycle our e-waste so that the bromine in the electronic devices, especially computer monitors, will not seep into the environment and harm the environment, including vegetation, animals, and humans. Reducing your exposure to bromine and related chemicals, such as potassium bromate will help you protect yourself from the toxic chemical, and this can be done by reduce the amount of e-waste in the environment. To protect yourself even further you should ensure you have adequate iodine levels, which can be accomplished by eating iodine-rich foods or taking a high-quality iodine supplement. </p>

<p class = "intro"> How to Recycle</p>
<ul>
	<li class = "textc">Computers are broken down into several parts, one of them known as cathode ray tube (CRT). </li>
	<li class = "textc">The hazardous material in computers is recycled through a patented process, and the CRT’s are recycled through a CRT machine.</li>
	<li class = "textc">The monitors are then taken apart into cables, circuit boards, and the most importantly, the monitor tube.</li>
	<li class = "textc">The monitor tube contains toxic ingredients and is made of glass that contains lead. </li>
<li class = "textc">Since the tube is sealed by a vacuum, it needs to be cautiously removed when the monitor is being dismantled.</li>
	<li class = "textc">The glass present in the technology is crushed and removed by the help of the Negative Pressure CRT Separation machine.</li>
<li class = "textc">The separation machine then breaks the glass into small particles that can be recycled.</li>
	<li class = "textc">Circuit boards are also broken, and magnets attract metals that are produced from the crushed pieces</li>
	<li class = "textc">Then, the process re-starts</li>
</ul>
