<h2 class = "sub">Inside of a Television</h2>  
<p class = "textc">A television contains a Cathode Ray Tube, also known as a CRT. The cathode ray tube contains a cathode and several pairs of anodes which are responsible for supplying current to the original cell. Steering coils are made out of copper that create magnetic fields inside the tube. The two set of coils allows the electron beam to be moved horizontally or vertically. Televisions are known to be one of the largest contributors to e-waste because of what they are made up of. For example, many contain hazardous chemicals such as Mercury and Lead and also consists of batteries, circuit boards, and display tubes. Statistics show that more than 98% of homes contain at least one television. This is a great number of family and recycling the television is very important so the materials inside it doesn't go to waste and are used in various situations including business.

<h2 class = "sub">Harmful Effects of Televisions</h2>  
<p class = "textc">Televisions also play a huge role in polluting our community. Televisions contain lead, mercury, cadmium, and flammable substances. There are about 4-8 pounds of lead in televisions. Lead is known to be the most harmful substance that causes pollution in electronics because it can damage the nervous system and cause brain and blood damage if people are exposed to it. Many symptoms exist due to the exposure of lead such as diarrhea, fatigue, coma, and sometimes death.  Mercury is also a harmful substance in televisions because it is responsible of harming the nervous system.  It is known as a neurotoxin, which means it can hinder brain functionality with other parts of the body.  Other parts in televisions can cause damage to the kidney and brain due to the extra amount of electricity present in the television.</p>

<h2 class = "sub">Television Recycling</h2> 
<p class = "textc">Televisions are also known to be one of the most difficult technology to recycle because of the countless materials present in the technology. When these are not recycled properly, they can cause toxins to be released into the air which pollutes the soil and water of our environment. During the recycling process, each individual component is dismantled, then sold to businessmen to reuse the materials in various ways. Television is one of the hardest technology to recycle and also causes the most pollution if not recycled properly. It is imperative that all individuals properly recycle their used televisions so it can be reused properly and cause less pollution</p>

<h2 class = "sub">Beryllium </h2> 
<p class = "textc">TVs are one of the most harmful electronic waste because of their massive size, and volume of toxic acids and chemicals. Beryllium is one of the main chemicals found in TVs. It is easy for beryllium particles to seep out of the TVs that have been left in landfills. These particles then pollute the ground as well as the water close by. According to NIOSH (the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2011), "workers exposed to particles, fumes, mists and solutions from beryllium-containing materials may develop beryllium sensitization or chronic beryllium disease, a potentially disabling or even fatal respiratory disease."</p>

<p class = "textc">Once the beryllium particles get into the ground and water, it is very easy for people to come into contact with it. Several diseases are associated with the beryllium disease. The diseases can affect different tissues and organs. Breathing in fumes or dusts of beryllium compounds may injure the lungs. Beryllium may also affect such organs as the liver, kidneys, heart, nervous system, and the lymphatic system.</p>

<p class = "textc">Direct contact with beryllium fumes or dusts may injure the exposed areas of the body, such as the eyes or the skin. Skin sensitization can also occur.  Beryllium is also a known cancer causing substance, with higher levels of lung cancer being reported. It is a confirmed human carcinogen by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH).

Acute beryllium disease may develop after a short and heavy exposure and usually last for less than one year. The disease has symptoms similar to pneumonia or bronchitis. Exposure usually occurs from touching contaminated ground soil, or water. To prevent excessive pollutants in the ground and water, TVs should be recycled so less exposure to toxic chemicals occur, and less harm will come to the environment, and the humans that interact with it. </p>

<h2 class = "sub">CRT's </h2>
<p class = "textc">Televisions also contain Cathode Ray Tubes, also known as a CRTs. The cathode ray tube contains a cathode and several pairs of anodes which are responsible for supplying current to the original cell. Steering coils are made out of copper that create magnetic fields inside the tube. The two set of coils allows the electron beam to be moved horizontally or vertically.

This is a great number of family and recycling the television is very important so the materials inside it doesn't go to landfills, and pollute the air, ground, and water.</p>

<p class = "intro"> How to Recycle</p>
<ul>
	<li class = "textc">Televisions can contain cathode ray tubes (CRT) which have up to eight pounds of lead</li>
	<li class = "textc">The process of recycling CRT is to dismantle the PC board, metals, and recyclable plastics.</li>
	<li class = "textc">Then the CRT is converted in a system called a conveyor system which crushes the CRT.</li>
	<li class = "textc">The crusher can process 100 to 150 CRT devices, over 15 tons of devices, per day</li>
	<li class = "textc">When the CRT is in the crusher, it is hit by a series of hammer mills that break the screens into bits of glass</li>
	<li class = "textc">Circuit boards are also broken, and magnets attract metals that are produced from the crushed pieces</li>
	<li class = "textc">These products that are safely extracted from the technology.</li>
