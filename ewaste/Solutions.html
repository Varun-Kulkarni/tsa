<p class = "inthead">Intro</p>
<p class = "textc">We understand that the best solution to the e-waste problem is recycling. However, after going to the e-waste centers and seeing it for ourselves, we discovered that recycling e-waste can be difficult and also has complications involved. Not only have we discovered the solution to e-waste, which is recycling, and researched how the recycling process works, but we also took an extra step, and found solutions to making the e-waste recycling process easier and ways to draw more attention to the e-waste 
issue. <br>

<a name="Substances"></a><br><p class = "inthead">Making Dangerous Substances Illegal</p><hr>
<p class = "textc">Some dangerous substances, such as PBC liquid, has been made illegal. However, there are many more highly toxic material that are continuing to be used in technology. Making some very toxic materials illegal will help the e-waste centers recycle objects more easily.<br></p>

<a name="Consumer"></a><br><p class = "inthead">Consumer Incentives</p><hr>
<p class = "textc">Some incentives to make consumers recycle e-waste more is to pay the consumer money for their object. Some companies already do this, and it is statistically proven, that these companies receive more consumers than the companies that don't.<br></p>

<a name="Biotechnology"></a><br><p class = "inthead">Using Biotechnology to Decompose E-waste or Remove Small Metal Parts</p><hr>
<p class = "textc">Using biotechnology is a great way to decompose unwanted things such as plastic. In some areas, mushrooms are being used to decompose some plastics. This will help the environment because instead of burning the plastics and releasing pollution, we could decompose it naturally.<br></p>

<a name="NewTech"></a><br><p class = "inthead">New Technology</p><hr>
<p class = "textc">New technology can help the e-waste problem in many ways. First it can help by identifying different metals, so that the metals can be easily removed from e-waste, and the process would be more efficient.<br></p>
<p class = "textc">Creating technology that wipes the memory of disks clean is another possible, so that the object does not have to be shredded, but can be reused.<br></p>
<p class = "textc">Using technology solution such as the WEEE- which is a machine that recycles the e-waste by cutting objects into small parts and recycling it, will allow the recycling process to be more efficient.</p>
<p class = "textc">We should keep trying to find new methods and innovate new ways to use less toxic material in the technology that we build so that it does not create much pollution. Hydrogen batteries are a great example. They don't use any harsh chemicals, so HCV can also reduce the e-waste. We should try to build our technology using less toxic chemicals so that not as much e-waste will be created.</p>



<a name="Education"></a><br><p class = "inthead">Education</p><hr>

<img src = "../IMG/ewaste/education e-waste pic.jpg" alt = "Children are being educated about e-waste and how important it is to recycle them" width="250" height="240" style="float: right; border: solid black 1px; padding: 2px"/>


<p class = "textc">Educating the public can help in a lot of different ways. First of all, telling consumers to separate electronics from other materials, will make e-waste recycling much easier for the e-waste centers.</p>



<p class = "textc">While some batteries can be recycled or reused, Lithium batteries are hard to recycle, and alkaline batteries cannot be recycled at all. Educating the public about this will convince consumers not to purchase things that are harmful to the environment such as alkaline batteries or lithium batteries, but to purchase batteries such as lead acid batteries, which can be used again or recycled.</p>



<p class = "textc"><br>Educational programs and e-waste collection locations have helped to collect more e-waste for recycling, so these programs should continue.

<br>Events for collections each year should be made, and permanent locations to collect e-waste should be established, if not already.

Ways to bring attention to this issue is by educating the public about the harms of e-waste. To do this, information must be available.</p>

<a name="Manufacturers"></a><br><p class = "inthead">Help from manufacturers- Every single interview mentioned that help from manufactures would greatly help e-waste centers everywhere, and make recycling much easier</p><hr>

<p class = "textc">Improving manufacturing in general by having manufacturers pay attention to the impact that their technology can have on the environment while they are building it, will greatly help recycling e-waste, because the technology was built with careful consideration.</p>

<p class = "textc">Many manufacturers do not tell e-waste centers how to recycle the products, or make the technology so that the products are very hard to dismantle. However, some companies do tell e-waste centers how to recycle and dismantle the objects, or make dismantling very easy. By having all companies follow this example, we can make recycling e-waste much, much easier.</p>

<p class = "textc"><br>Mandates that force manufactures tell the e-waste companies how to recycle their product will make it much easier to recycle the technology in the end. Smaller objects cause more pollution because they are hard to dismantle. Companies that make these small objects should tell the e-waste centers how to recycle it.  Support from manufacturers to build objects that can be taken apart can be helpful to the e-waste recycling process.</p>



<p class = "textc">A big problem is that manufacturers are not taking responsibility for TV e-waste, and letting TVs create pollution. Having manufacturers take responsibility will help the e-waste problem.</p>



<a name="WorkForce"></a><br><p class = "inthead">Trained Work Force</p><hr>



<p class = "textc">When we visited the e-waste centers, we noticed that many companies use human labor to dismantle the electronics. A trained work force will make that recycling process much easier and more efficient.</p>



<a name="Overall"></a><br><p class = "inthead">Overall</p><hr>


<p class = "textc">Overall the biggest solution is trying to reduce pollution when creating objects, by being wise of what chemicals are added, and considering how to create the object so that it would be easy to recycle when used up. This can be achieved through help from manufactures. We should also try to recycle more, make better, environmentally friendly technology, educate the public, and innovate new ideas for cutting down e-waste pollution.</p>

<br><p class = "textc">The most important thing we can do right now is to build our technology wisely. We should consider what the consequences will be once the technology is used. We need to be attentive of what is going into the trash, and draw more attention to this issue.</p>
