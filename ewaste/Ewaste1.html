	<p class = "textc">E-waste is a vital issue that needs to be addressed to improve the health of our community. E-waste is harmful to the environment because of the pollution it releases from the materials in the technology. Electronics such as computers, cell-phones, television, are capable of recycling. However, most electronics are thrown away instead of being recycled, which end up causing pollution in the environment. There are 40 million tons of e-waste produced  each year. 80-85% of the electronic products that are thrown into landfills cause toxins to be discarded into the environment. Loudoun County itself produces 2% of our waste each year which is about 6,000 tons of waste. Loudoun County, however, tries to address this issue by publicly advertising programs which promote e-waste recycling. E-waste is an important issue which needs to be resolved in order to protect our community from harmful toxins. </p>

<h4 class = "intro">Harmful Effects of E-Waste</h4><hr>

<li class = "mainPageLists"><u> Environmental Impacts</u><br></li>

	<p class = "textc">E-waste is hazardous to the environment because it releases toxins into the air and water, which ends up killing many organisms. 40 million tons of e-waste is produced all around the world and only 13% of this amount is recycled properly. E-waste that is thrown away goes through combustion which release toxic pollution in the air which can spread rapidly, causing several diseases from toxic poisoning. The cathode ray tube (CRT), which is used in televisions, can cause heavy metals such as lead and extremely toxic phosphorus to be drained in ground water. Circuit boards that are disposed in the environment, also contain lead that can contaminate surface water and groundwater. E-waste which is thrown away into landfills, ends up harming the environment in more ways than we think.</p> 

<a class = "eWasteHomeLink"  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5oi4QOeQ3I">Click here to see a video on how environment is negatively affected.</a>
<br>
<br>
<li class = "mainPageLists"><u> Health Impacts</u><br></li>

<p class = "textc">E-waste in the environment ends up harming the health of many plants and animals. It can cause damage to lungs, skin, and kidney. Exposure from toxic chemicals to humans mostly occurs through the air. Once exposure occurs, nervous, immune, and reproductive system can abnormally change from severe toxic chemicals entering the body. Additionally, lead is known to cause brain damage and death to all organisms from exposure. Lead is considered one of the most toxic material that is used in electronics. Health is negatively affected by the e-waste pollution. In order to protect our community from toxic e-waste chemicals, we must recycle our electronics instead of discarding them into landfills.</p>

<br><br>
<li class = "mainPageLists"><u> Water Impacts</u> <br></li>

<p class = "textc">E-waste also harms the ocean hurting many sea creatures who live in it. Heavy metals and Hydrocarbon are released into the water where they pollute the ocean, killing sea creatures. Toxic waste is often dumped into the oceans, rivers, and lakes. These actions pollute the water, causing ocean life to be in risk. Once a certain group of ocean life are killed from the toxic poisoning, other sea creatures can be effected as well, because within the ecosystem all animals depend on each other for food or protection. Additionally, e-waste pollution can hurt individuals due to the transfer of toxic materials in their households. E-waste can harm ocean life as well as individuals from toxic exposure. </p>
