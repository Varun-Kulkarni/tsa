  <p class="inthead">Motto</p> 
  <p class="during">Make a difference to our nation by joining Technology Student Association </p> 
  <p class="inthead">What is TSA?</p> 
  <p class="textc">The Technology Student Association is a club where students can create projects based on different technological concepts. In TSA students get the chance to take on different challenging projects, and find solutions to technological problems. Team members work together in competitive events, attend conferences on the state and national levels, and do different chapter activities. </p> 
  <p class="inthead">Creed</p> 
  <p class="textc">We believe that TSA holds the key to our future by building a more technologically advanced world. The advancements made in science, medicine, and technology will create a better and stronger community. We hope to inspire others to do the same, and shape our future for the better. We want to help our society thrive by identifying the technological problems and using our critical thinking skills to solve them. By participating in TSA, we are able to enhance our technological skills, and address problems within society, while inspiring others to do the same.</p>

    <p class="inthead">Resources Available for our Chapter</p> 
    <p class="textc">TSA provides countless opportunities for young individuals to thrive in STEM related programs. TSA provides various opportunities for students to use tools such as Laser Engravers, Plasma Cutters and AutoDesk Inventor software for Computer Aided Drafting and Design. These technologies introduce several new concepts to individuals, and inspire them to use these technologies to improve their society.</p> 

    <p class="inthead">Skills Gained Through TSA</p> 
    <p class="textc">Individuals learn how to collaborate as a team and work together with different kinds of people. They also learn how to analyze significant problems that are not addressed often, and find creative ways to bring attention to them. Individuals are also able to learn how to analyze the situation and find other possible solutions than those already implemented. </p> 

    <p class="inthead">Competitions</p> 
    <p class="textc">Our first year of TSA has been successful so far.  In our Northern Virginia Regional Conference, we were able to get 4th place in the Essays on Technology event and 5th place in the Video Game Design event.  During our first year, we participated in Video Game Design, Extemporaneous Speech, Prepared Presentation, and Essay on Technology at the regional level. At our State Conference, the Virginia Technosphere, our chapter had entries for Biotechnology Design, On-Demand Video, and Webmaster.  We were able to get in the top 10 finalists for Biotechnology Design and we were able to win 2nd place overall in Webmaster. </p>

    <p class="inthead">Community service projects</p> 
    <p class="textc">Since our school opened just this year, we are trying to put together community service projects such as fundraising for the American Cancer Society by candy sales.</p> 

    <p class="inthead">Activities Our Chapter Has Done</p> 
    <p class="textc">Our TSA chapter is new and we offer great opportunities for all individuals. We advertise our club by publicly announcing about our club every morning and trying to recruit new members who are interested in STEM related programs in TSA. We also put up flyers all around the school to promote our club.</p> 
    <p class="textc">In addition to this, to raise money for our chapter for competitions we conducted a fundraiser.  Originally this was for our video game team because they needed money for the software that they needed to develop.  To raise money, we made small plaques out of wood for the teacher to hand on their doors.  Tech Ed students in our TSA Chapter made order forms with the teacher's names, titles, classes they teach, etc.  After all of us handed out these forms, we got to work on making the plates.  Each plaque was $20.00 and we were able to raise over 200 dollars to use for our
	regional fairs and other fees</p>
